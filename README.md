# SevenDatabasesInSevenWeeks
Vagrant environments to aid setup in the book 'Seven databases in seven weeks' by Pragmatic Programmers

## Setting up with Vagrant

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following software installed on your development machine: 
* Virtualbox
* Vagrant 

I suggest you use your native/favourite package manager to install these (for windows see [chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/), Mac OSX: [homebrew](), linux: apt-get :))

### Setup

Open a terminal or command prompt and change directory to the root directory of your working copy of this repository.

Then run the command:

```Batchfile
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Now follow the chapter instructions from the book ;-)
